## Process & Design

Every website should be designed for a target audience. It is important to understand who your target audience is.

When you know what needs to appear on the site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

* **Site Maps** aim to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site

* **Card Sorting** is a technique that can help you decide what information should go on each page

**Wireframing** is a sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. Shows the hierachy of the information and how much space it might require.

* You can sketch wireframes on paper or on a graphics application on the computer (like Illustrator or InDesign)

The primary aim of visual design is to communicate and make sure the message shines through. With so much on a webpage the author needs to organize and prioritize the information to communicate their message and help users find what they're looking for.

* **Visual Hierachy** is created to help users focus on the key messages that will draw users attention.

* *Grouping together* related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler.

* **Similarity** is done by presenting certain types of information in a similiar visual style so users associate that style with the particular content.
