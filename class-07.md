# Tables, Functions, Methods, and Objects

## Table

A `table` represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, tv schedules, and sports results.

Grids allow us to understand complex data by refrencing information on two axes.

Each block in the grid is referred to as a `table cell`. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

Table Structure

`<table>` element is used to create a table. The contents for a table are written out in a row

`<tr>` You indicate the start of each row using the opening `<tr>` tag. (tr stands for table row)

`<td>` Each cell of a table is represented using a `<td>` element. (td stands for table data)

`<th>` element is used just like the `<td>` element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

*For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`*

`<thead>`: the heading of the table should sit inside the `<thead>` element

`tbody`: The body should sit inside the `<tbody>` element

`<tfoot>`: The footer belongs inside the `<tfoot>` element

## Creating an object: Constuctor Notation

What is a constructor? It is a function that creates object `instances` and uses parameters to assign `unique` property value

The `new` key word and the object constructor create a blank object. You can then add properties and methods to the object.

Example:

`hotel.name = 'Park';`

* hotel is the object
* name is the property
* . is the member operator
* = is the assignment operator
* park is the property name
