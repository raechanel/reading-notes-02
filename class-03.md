# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

***

## Lists

HTML has three different types of lists:

1. ***Ordered Lists*** are list where each item in the list are numbered.
2. ***Unordered Lists*** are list that begin with a bullet point (that don't indicate order)
3. ***Definition Lists*** are used to define terminology

***Ordered Lists*** are created with the `<ol>` element.

***Unordered Lists*** are created with the `<ul>` element.

Each item in the lists (***list item***) is made with the element `<li>`

## Control Flow wtih JavaScript

`If...Else` statement checks a condition. If it resolves to be true the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to be false the second code box is run instead.

* Example: `if (score >= 50) {congratulate(; )} "congraulate" is what should be executed if the value is true. else { encourage ();} "encourage" is the code to be executed if the value is false`



| Data Type | Purpose                                                  |
| --------- | ------------                                             |
| `string`  | Text                                                     |
| `number`  | Number                                                   |
| `Boolean` | true or false                                            |
| `null`     | Empty value                                             |
| `undefined` | Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value|

## The CSS Box Model

CSS treats HTML elements as if it is in its own box

Every box haas three properties that can be adjusted to control the appearance:

1. ***Border*** seperates the edge of one box from another

2. ***Margin*** sits outside the edge of the border. This creates a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes

3. ***Padding*** is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
