## HTML

Tags are also known as markup. There are two types of markup:

* **Structural markup** is elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
  * example: `<h1> <h2>`
* **Semantic markup** provides extra information like emphasis placed in a sentence.
  * example: `<abbr> <cite>`

## CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box and the contents of that box are presented.

CSS associates style rules with HTML elements and CSS properties affect how elements are displayed.

CSS declarations are made up of two parts: a property and a value, seperated by a colon.

* ***Properties*** indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example: `color`, `font`, `width`, `height`, and `border`.

* ***Values*** specify the setting you want for the chosen property. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in the element to be.

* CSS rules usualy appear in a seperate document but may appear within an html page.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is like giving instructions for a browser to follow.

***Statements*** A script of a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instructions or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon `;`.

Statements are instructions and each should appear on a new line.

***Comments*** are notes ro help you and or others explain what your code does.

* Single line comments are made by two forward slashes and then the message.
  * Example:  `// this is a single line comment`
*Multiline comments are made by starting with a forward slash and an astrik then the message ending with an astrik and a foward slash .
  * Example: `/* This would be used for a multi line comment */`

A script will temporarily store bits of information it needs to do the job. It stores this data in ***variables***.
